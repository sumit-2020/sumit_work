We developed a simple and effective model to generate images based on text description. We demonstrated the potential in unsupervised learning and transfer learning by using pre-trained skip-thought vectors which generalized well in this task. Some real world applications of such a translation can be : producing synthetic images for a search query instead of choosing from the database, description based criminal sketching. This would require scaling-up the model and training on a more generic text and image database.
